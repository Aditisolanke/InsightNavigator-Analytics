Companies will need to diversify sourcing strategies to mitigate these risks.</li> <li><strong>Consumer Education:</strong> Although Glycyrrhizin Extractum is known for its benefits, many consumers are still unfamiliar with its uses beyond traditional medicine. Education campaigns will be essential for fostering wider adoption in mainstream markets.</li> <li><strong>Competitive Landscape:</strong> The growing popularity of other herbal extracts and the rise of synthetic substitutes for natural ingredients may lead to increased competition in the Glycyrrhizin market.
